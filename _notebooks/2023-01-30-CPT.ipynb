    "We aim to create a platform in which individuals are able to find romantic or platonic relationships. We aim to implement a chat box, google map integration, profile creation, profile matching, and personality testing. I will be working with all aspects of the project as one the main backend and frontend developers. I will however be spending more time focused on the map integration and the user interface. We have already created an overall theme to build off of and I would like to create a cohesive project integrating this theme. I will also be working on the google map integration. This feature will integrate and api and a database as we aim to show users in a specific area. This itself may not be enough for my Personal CPT but can be an smaller part of an overall project. "
