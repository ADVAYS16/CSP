<h1 id="my-thoughts">My Thoughts</h1>

<p>I was quite proud of my word for Section 5 and 7. I spent considerable time learning the information and applying it in the hacks. I feel that I agree with my scores and although I am proud of my work, I feel that I could have done something extra as I had time.</p>

<h1 id="vocab">Vocab</h1>

<h2 id="unit-2-binarydata-terms">Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms</h2>
<p>Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles : Various ways of representing data.</p>

<p>Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point : Floating points are decimals, unsigned integers are integers without a sing (abs value), and signed integers have signs</p>

<p>Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB - these are various representations of binary, ASCII is characters, unicode and RGB are colors, booleans are 1s and 0, on and off</p>

<p>Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed yet) : lossy is compressing, but you may lose data. Lossless is the opposite, as it does not lose data.</p>

<h2 id="unit-3-algorithmprogramming-terms--">Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms -</h2>

<p>Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators : Variables are variable holders of values, data types are the types of what they can be, and assignment operators assign values to variables</p>

<p>Managing Complexity with Variables:  Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class
Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration : These are ways to manage complexity through abstraction of various data and procedures that influence</p>

<p>Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables : Ways of representing true and false operators, mainly between the 1s and 0s of binary. True trumps false in OR, but fails to in AND.</p>

<p>Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings : Strings are plaintext, and these are various ways of manipulating strings. Making them upper and lower case, adding more string to the string, and iterating over them.</p>

<p>Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements : Conditionals, if checks if something is true. Elif checks if the above if statement isn’t true, and else checks if nothing above ois true.</p>

<p>Python For, While loops with Range, with List : various loops to iterate over iterables. While loops have a conditional, loop over range loops over a range of numbers, and for loops over an iterable.</p>

<p>Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue : continue resets the loop, break breaks out of it
Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values : Ways of managing complexity in repeatable procedures (def in python). These return return values and contain parameters that influence the output.</p>
