            "content": "Night at the Museum was an incredible experience and I had a great time. I enjoyed visiting other classes and experiencing other teams present their projects. One team had created a forum in which users could comment and write, which I found captivating. I was also able to reflect on my groups work. For example, after reviewing other projects, I felt that we could have integrated our different roles in a singular element. I saw a group who had built a hangman in which they used an api, stored data, and had frontend design. Unlike our group, they were able to make a project in which all items could be used in one element. Another class I visited was 3D Animation. I was surprised by the realism and noticed the intricacy involved. Many of the animations had shadows and a subject which captured my attention. I was really interested in Ceramics. I plan on taking the class later in highschool and was fascinated by the designs. I felt that the octopus was by far the best one. It had specific tentacles and suckers. Lastly, it felt good to present our work and effort. Images can be seen below. .",

Aryan Religion . - Development of an elaborate religious system that placed enormous emphasis on ritual sacrifice to the pantheon of gods - Priests had the highest place in the caste system because of their responsibility in carrying out the religious ceremonies in honor of the gods - The rituals were highly complex and had to be carried out exactly according to tradition for their goal (fertility of the soil, rain, ect.) - Passed down through oral tellings - Around 1000 BCE the texts were committed to written down as the Vedas, the oldest bodies of religious writing known - The Vedas represent the oldest strain of Indian religious literature and are still chanted by Hindus at all important moments in Indian religious life (birth, naming ceremonies, rites of passage to adulthood, in sickness, and at death) Philosophy - Rig Veda, a new kind of literature came into being interested in the large philosophical issues of the nature of human existence Recorded in classical Indian texts - Upanishads - The fundamental worldview of the Upanishads is identified in two forms: - The ultimate reality is an impersonal reality called Brahman - Each individual person has within the self Brahman, which, in a person, is called Atman - The secret of life is to come to the knowledge that Brahman is the ultimate reality (one’s inner self is part of this fundamental reality) and everything else is, in a certain fashion, permeable and “unreal . Hinduism . - “Those from the Indus Valley” - Highly ritualized worship of the gods - Strong traditions to find the ultimate reality of the cosmos and those who live in it - Hinduism is both a religion of the priest and the temple and of solitary meditation and study - Inside a person, Brahman is known as Atman: - Innermost, transcendental self - Material self causes inner self to be lost - True happiness and moksha (getting out of the samsara cycle) - Paths of Hinduism - The path of discipline (yoga) and aestheticism (fasting, bodily control) that leads away from materialism and towards enlightenment - The path of discipline of karma, performing your duties (sacrifice for greater good, selflessness) - The path of devotion in which all deeds are for the gods or one god, creating a spiritual life Hindu Art - Religious in Spirit - Decorate the temples in narrative stories of the Hindu deities - Eroticism: belief that sexual union is equal to union with the gods -The sense of unity of all forms of life is shown by Vishnu—the supreme Hindu spirit—appearing in a series of avatars, or incarnations, of various animals and humans - Over time, scenes from the Mahabharata and other great Hindu epics combined the elements of eroticism and naturalism .

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive.

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
