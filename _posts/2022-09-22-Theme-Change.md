<p>I was able to change the overall theme to purple and the text to black. I think it was a bit more difficult to read and less aesthetically pleasing. I later also returned to dark theme and changed the text color to green. Overall I liked the green text but I did not like the purple background. I also noticed that the changes to Fastpages caused the blog to be slow and buggy.</p>
