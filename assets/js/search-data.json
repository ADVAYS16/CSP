John . Explanation Everything is Sequencing. for person in ListofPeople is iteration, as it iterates over the set list of names. if len(person) &lt; 5: is selection, as it selects for a name with less than 5 letters. . Example 2 . for i in range(5): if i % 2 == 1: print(3) . 3 3 . Explanation Everything is sequencing for i in range(5) is iteration, as it iterates over the range [1,5]. if num % 2 == 1 is selection, as it selects for a odd number . Video 2 . Find the value for a, b, c, d | a = 1, b = 7, c = 3, d = 7 | . What are the values of hot and cold after executing the code segment? | Hot = true, cold = true | . My Own Examples . { a = 1 b = 2 c = 3 d = 4 e = 5 f=(a+b+c+d+e) result = f display(result) } . Answer: 15 because 1+2+3+4+5=15. . { a = 2 b = 4 c = a*b d = a*b*c e = (a+b+c+d)/(d-b) display(e) } . Answer: . c = 8 d = 64 e = 2+4+8+64/(6-2) = 78/4 = 19.5 because based on the values of a and b, c must be 24=8, d must be 24*8=64. By finding the values of A,B,C, and D we can then calculate the value of E. . Concatenation .

            "content": "Hack 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable problems: A problem in which an algorithm can be used to solve or produce outputs in a finite number of steps. Undecidable problems: A problems where there is no algorithm that can be built to provide a solution for all parameters. . number = 20 #set number equal to random value if number &gt; 10: # if the number is greater than 10 print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) #print else: # if less than 10 print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) # print . greater than 10 . num = 1 while num == 0: # the number will never equal 0 since we set it to 1, so this is undecidable print(num) num = num + 1 . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . A variable multiplied by an integer to the power of two. This algorithm fits this criteria. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . Hack 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function run_peak_finder() { let array_r= (3,5,7,5) print (peak_finder(array_r)) } function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length print (`The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak`) }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length print(`The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak`) } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length print (`The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak`) }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . function findpeak(ar) { var peak = -Infinity; // Cycle through all the elements of the array for(var i = 0; i &lt; ar.length; i++) { var el = ar[i]; // If an element is of type array then invoke the same function // to find out the maximum element of that subarray if ( Array.isArray(el) ) { el = findpeak( el ); } if ( el &gt; peak ) { peak = el; } } return peak; } . I was a bit confused on how to tackle this problem and I tried to utilize a recursive function. I am not really sure how to write this code optimally and would like to learn more about recursive functions. . Hack 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] data_sorted = data.sort print(data_sorted) . &lt;built-in method sort of list object at 0x7fa8a13b6840&gt; . This method is much more efficient as it no longer needs while loops to sort through the data set. I utilized a built in method to sort the data. . Hack 5 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def runPermutations(lst, output = []): if len(lst) == 0: print(output) return else: for i in range(len(lst)): runPermutations(lst[:i]+lst[i+1:], output+lst[i:i+1]) runPermutations([&quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;]) .

Reflection . I am thoroughly interested in the recursive function and the utilization of the permutation method. I enjoyed learning about undecidable vs undecidable problems, and how to make code more efficient. I am not entirely sure on the uses of a recursive function and would like to learn more about how to apply it. | .",

Libraries allow a user to reference pre written code. Documentation is a process in which an individual explains code. API&#39;s (application program interfaces) specify how procedures in libraries should behave and be utilized. I was introduced to the random function and I learned of its application. For example we can use randrange, randint, and random to specify the random value being provided. . (2) Multiple Choice . What does the random(a,b) function generate? . A.

I feel that I agree with my scores and although I am proud of my work, I feel that I could have done something extra as I had time. . Vocab . Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms . Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles : Various ways of representing data. . Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point : Floating points are decimals, unsigned integers are integers without a sing (abs value), and signed integers have signs . Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB - these are various representations of binary, ASCII is characters, unicode and RGB are colors, booleans are 1s and 0, on and off . Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed yet) : lossy is compressing, but you may lose data. Lossless is the opposite, as it does not lose data. . Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms - . Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators : Variables are variable holders of values, data types are the types of what they can be, and assignment operators assign values to variables . Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration : These are ways to manage complexity through abstraction of various data and procedures that influence . Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables : Ways of representing true and false operators, mainly between the 1s and 0s of binary. True trumps false in OR, but fails to in AND. . Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings : Strings are plaintext, and these are various ways of manipulating strings. Making them upper and lower case, adding more string to the string, and iterating over them. . Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements : Conditionals, if checks if something is true. Elif checks if the above if statement isn’t true, and else checks if nothing above ois true. . Python For, While loops with Range, with List : various loops to iterate over iterables. While loops have a conditional, loop over range loops over a range of numbers, and for loops over an iterable. . Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue : continue resets the loop, break breaks out of it Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values : Ways of managing complexity in repeatable procedures (def in python). These return return values and contain parameters that influence the output. .",

            "content": "3.5-3.7 Notes . 3.5 . Write expressions with logical operators and evaluate expressions that use logical operators . Vocab/Big Ideas . Boolean- binary variable with only two possible values, “true” or “false” There are multiple operators used to evaluate 2 variables. In pseudocode the relational operators are =, &gt;, &lt;, ≠, ≥, and ≤. Python uses != instead of ≠. These operators help determine the boolean value of a statement. . Logical Operators . Logical operators allow for boolean values to be evaluated. Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. Javascript uses the same logic, but uses different ways to represent the operators: &amp;&amp;(and), | |(or), |(not). . Relational Operators Table Value 1 and Value 2(And operator) Value 1 Value 2 Result . True | True | True | . True | False | False | . False | True | False | . False | False | False | . Value 1 or Value 2(Or operator) Value 1 Value 2 Result . True | True | True | . True | False | True | . False | True | True | . False | False | False | . Not operator Not Value Result . Not | True | False | . Not | False | True | . ## 3.6 &gt; Write conditional statements ### Vocab and Big Ideas - *Algorithm*: Finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task - *Conditional Statements*: allow the code to act based on multiple conditions, such as user input or stored data - use in order to receive different outputs from a set of code, and help achieve the general purpose of the algorithm - *Categories*: 2 broad types of conditional statements are if statements and if-else statements - *if statement*: will go through certain statements if the if expression is true - *if-else statement*: will go through a statement no matter what, but the statement which is run depends on the if expression is true or false ## 3.7 &gt; Write nested conditional statements, determine the result of them ### Vocab and Big Ideas - *Nested conditional*: A conditional inside of a conditional. Used in algorithms in order to print specific data or run certain tasks, to create further conditions in algorithms. We can use flowcharts to help display an easy to understand diagram of what we want a code segment to do. # 3.5 Hacks ## Binary Practice Using psuedocode operators determine if the statements are true or false. The number type will be indicated in parentheses. **1. 90(Decimal) = 1000(Binary)** - A. True - B. False - Answer: B False **2. 10(D) ≠ 0110(B)** - A. True - B. False - Answer: A True **3. 56(D) ≥ 111000(B)** - A. True - B. False - Answer: A True **3. 99(D) &lt; 1110011(B)** - A. True - B. False - Answer: A True Now, complete the binary truth tables AND Operator Value 1 Value 2 Result . 1 | 1 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | 0 | . 0 | 1 | 0 | . 0 | 0 | 0 | . OR Operator Value 1 Value 2 Result . 1 | 1 | 1 | . 1 | 0 | 1 | . 0 | 1 | 1 | . 0 | 0 | 0 | . Not operator Not Value Result . Not | 1 | 0 | . Not | 0 | 0 | . . ## Python Practice # Testing out relational operators # Practice with these statements print(20 &lt; 20) # How can you change the operator to print a value of False? x = 30 y = 20 z = 10 print(x &gt;= y + z) # How can this return true by only manipulating the operator? x = 30 z = 30 print(x == z) # Change values to return true # 3.6 Hacks ## AP Prep **1. What is displayed by this code?** - result &lt;-- 75 - IF result &lt; 80 { DISPLAY(&quot;Please schedule a retake.&quot;) } - ELSE { DISPLAY(&quot;Nice job!&quot;) } 1. Nice job! 2. Display 3. Please schedule a retake. 4. 75 - 3 &quot;Please schedule a retake.&quot; Because the if condition is met, 75 &lt; 80 so the if display is shown. **2. How is an if statement different from an if-else statement.** 1. Extra words. 2. An if statement will only go through a process if a condition is met. An if-else statement will go through code no matter the conditions. 3. They are the exact same. 4. An if statement will go through the entire code segment every single time and the if-else statement is always used in an algorithm, no matter the conditions. - 2 Because in if statements the criteria needs to be made in order to go through the code. **3. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Ben wants to check his bank account. If his car fuel is full, he will go to the bank. Otherwise, he will go home. If he goes to the bank, he will withdraw money only if his balance is above $1000.** 1. If statement 2. If-else statement - 2 If-else, because if he has gas he will go to the bank BUT else (gas is not full) he will go home. **4. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Luke wants to play basketball. If it is sunny outside he will go to the park to play basketball.** 1. If statement 2. If-else statement - 1 as there is no second option. It does not specify what Luke will do on a day when it is not sunny. ## Using Python animals = [&quot;lion&quot;, &quot;tiger&quot;, &quot;wildebeest&quot;, &quot;shark&quot;, &quot;jellyfish&quot;, &quot;blobfish&quot;, &quot;raven&quot;] for i in animals: if i == &quot;shark&quot;: # What boolean value does this statement cause? Answer: True print(&quot;Fun Fact: The smallest shark is the dwarf lantern shark, and it is small enough to hold in your hand!&quot;) else: print(i) for i in animals: if i == &quot;lion&quot; or &quot;wildebeest&quot; or &quot;raven&quot;: print(&quot;This animal lives in the desert&quot;) else: print(i + &quot; This animal does not live in the desert&quot;) # Practice # Using only one more if statement, alter the code to print out a statement saying if an animal lives in the desert, based on booleans # 3.7 Hacks ## Exercise 1 - Create dictionaries for multiple food items, with the listed specifications - Chicken Alfredo, Meat: Chicken, Time to Prepare: 60 minutes - Cheese Quesadilla, Meat: None, Time to Prepare: 10 minutes - Beef Wellington, Meat: Beef, Time to Prepare: 150 minutes - Used nested conditionals, determine which meal you can cook, given that a) you have no meat at home, and b) you only have 30 minutes to make the meal # Write code here chickenAlfredo = { &quot;meat&quot;: True, &quot;Time&quot;: 60, } cheeseQuesadilla = { &quot;meat&quot;: False, &quot;Time&quot;: 10, } beefWellington = { &quot;meat&quot;: True, &quot;Time&quot;: 150, } def cookMeal(dish): if dish[&quot;Time&quot;] &lt;= 30: if dish[&quot;meat&quot;] == False: print(&quot;You can cook the meal!&quot;) else: print(&quot;You do not have enough time and cannot cook the meal!&quot; ) else: print(&quot;You do not have meat and cannot cook the meal!&quot;) cookMeal(chickenAlfredo) cookMeal(cheeseQuesadilla) cookMeal(beefWellington) ## Exercise 2 Make a flowchart and write pseudocode for the following scenario. - Mr. Yeung would like to grade live reviews. - He wants to see if each student has at least 2 issues on their project. If they don&#39;t they receive a score of 2.0. - If they have at least 2 issues, check that they have completed at least 5 of their scrumboard tasks. - If they have completed 5 scrumboard tasks, give the student a 2.7. If they have not completed 5 scrumboard tasks, give them a score of 2.5. If they have completed more than 5 tasks, give them a score of 3.0. - How much would a student with 3 issues and 1 complete scrumboard task receive? ![Alt text](../images/images/flowchart.png) A student with 3 issues and 1 completed scrumboard task would receive a 2.5. .",

Due to this I missed both of the lessons. I feel that I could have been more thorough with my work for both of the sections. Something I want to do next time is blog about the lessons or add my personal reflection. Along side these blog posts I feel that I should review the material taught by the group in order to gain a deeper understanding. I think that I should also write down what the homework for each section is as I found it hard to find where the hacks were posted.

            "title": "Final Corrections",
            "content": "Overall: . I felt pretty good about my Final Attempt. I did struggle on a few questions and missed 6 in total. A Majority of the questions I missed were regarding the analysis of a specific piece of code. I was unsure on what the code did exactly and took an educated guess on a few of them. I feel that I could have done better if I had revised my answers as I feel that I could have caught some simple mistakes. Also I found it difficult to understand exactly what some of the coded segments were implying due to the format. . Specifics: . I was still confused on a few questions even after reviewing the answers. For example, question 35 was related to setting the value of a variable based of an existing value of time. I reviewed the answer and realized that my selected answer was assigning the opposite value. Instead of setting 30 for when time is greater than 1 I was setting 50. Although I see why Answer A is correct, I am still confused as why “maxPS=50” is placed above the if else statement. . Question 36: . Consider the following code segment, which is intended to store ten consecutive even integers, beginning with 2, in the list evenList. Assume that evenList is initially empty. . i ← ← 1 REPEAT 10 TIMES { &lt;MISSING CODE&gt; } Which of the following can be used to replace &lt;MISSING CODE&gt; so that the code segment works as intended? . My code did not generate the correct list. Instead of initializing 1 it initialized 0. . Question 40: I said that nothing will be displayed. This is incorrect as the code segment will display regardless of x and y values. . Question 41: I selected the initial value of P rather than the value of r after the code has ran. . Question 45: . Consider the following code segment. theList ← ← [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] count1 ← ← 0 count2 ← ← 0 FOR EACH value IN theList { IF(value &gt; 0) { count1 ← ← count1 + 1 } ELSE { count2 ← ← count2 + 1 } } What are the values of count1 and count2 as a result of executing the code segment? I am unsure of my mistake and need help understanding why this occurred. . Question 48: My answer was incorrect as Y is changing after the code segment runs. . What Next?: . For the next final or test I feel that I can work on rereading and revisiting questions. By simply returning to a question with a blank mind, I feel like I could have approached the question differently. Many times I felt a bit confused by the format of the code and variables included. This confusion caused many of my mistakes and I feel that I could have answered them correctly by simply revisiting the question. . .",

One team had created a forum in which users could comment and write, which I found captivating. I was also able to reflect on my groups work. For example, after reviewing other projects, I felt that we could have integrated our different roles in a singular element. I saw a group who had built a hangman in which they used an api, stored data, and had frontend design. Unlike our group, they were able to make a project in which all items could be used in one element. Another class I visited was 3D Animation. I was surprised by the realism and noticed the intricacy involved. Many of the animations had shadows and a subject which captured my attention. I was really interested in Ceramics. I plan on taking the class later in highschool and was fascinated by the designs. I felt that the octopus was by far the best one. It had specific tentacles and suckers. Lastly, it felt good to present our work and effort. Images can be seen below. .

The Ramayana . - Rama is an avatar of the god Vishnu. - Rama is born the son of Dasharatha, the King of Kosola - He has an auspicious birth. The first of four sons after a long period of kingly infertility. - One day, the sage, Vishvamitra comes looking for help dealing with the Rakshasas. - Married to Sita - 12 years later, Bharata, Rama&#39;s younger brother, is named his father’s successor instead of Rama - Rama is banished to the forest for 14 years with Sita and his loyal brother Lakshmana - Defeat a demon, visit a hermitage, receive a magical bow with infinite arrows, make friends with a celestial eagle who promises to watch over Sita - The Rakshashas learn of Rama&#39;s exile and send an army of 14,000 that Rama defeats with his magic bow - When Sita is left alone, Ravana swipes her in his flying chariot - The wounded protector eagle tells Rama where to find Ravana and Sita - Their journey leads them to the Monkey Kingdom and Rama impresses the monkey king with his archery so the monkeys agree to help him . The Mahabharata . - Important source of information on the development of Hinduism between 400 BCE and 200 CE - Regarded by Hindus as both a text about Dharma (Hindu moral law) and history - The poem was an oral epic that reflects the intersection of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism - The poem is made up of almost 100,000 couplets divided into 18 parvans - Traditionally ascribed to the sage Krishan Dwaipayana Vyasa - Exposition of dharma (codes of conduct), - Proper conduct of a king, of a warrior, of an individual living in times of calamity, and of a person seeking to attain moksha (freedom from samsara, or rebirth) - The Mahabharata is a mass of mythological material arranged around a heroic narrative of the struggle for power between two groups of cousins, the Kauravas (sons of Dhritarashtra, the descendant of Kuru) and the Pandavas (sons of Pandu) -The first section is a dramatic gambiling match with Yudhishthira, the weak and confused embodiment of dharma and the trickster Duryodhana who humiliates Draupadi and unleashes the uncontainable energy of the conflict -Hanuman is a monkey - The son of the wind and he is able to fly over the ocean to locate Sita - Rama leads a monkey army across the sea to battle Ravana&#39;s forces for several days ending when Rama shoots Ravana in the heart - Rama does not immediately take back Sita because he said it would be dishonorable to be with a woman who was with someone else for a year - Sita goes through a trial by fire to prove her faithfulness - When she steps into a fire, the fire god protects her, proving her purity - Rama accepts Sita and says he only questioned her to preserve his dharma, his individual duties and responsibilities within the cosmic pattern - Rama asks the god Indra to bring all the monkeys who died in the war back to life - Rama and Sita fly with all the monkeys to Ayodhya, where Rama is crowned king and rules wisely over his kingdom for 10,000 years - Shows the principles of dharma to behave appropriately as a dutiful son, a brother, a powerful military leader, a protector of his beloved, and a stern leader. . Aryan Religion . - Development of an elaborate religious system that placed enormous emphasis on ritual sacrifice to the pantheon of gods - Priests had the highest place in the caste system because of their responsibility in carrying out the religious ceremonies in honor of the gods - The rituals were highly complex and had to be carried out exactly according to tradition for their goal (fertility of the soil, rain, ect.) - Passed down through oral tellings - Around 1000 BCE the texts were committed to written down as the Vedas, the oldest bodies of religious writing known - The Vedas represent the oldest strain of Indian religious literature and are still chanted by Hindus at all important moments in Indian religious life (birth, naming ceremonies, rites of passage to adulthood, in sickness, and at death) Philosophy - Rig Veda, a new kind of literature came into being interested in the large philosophical issues of the nature of human existence Recorded in classical Indian texts - Upanishads - The fundamental worldview of the Upanishads is identified in two forms: - The ultimate reality is an impersonal reality called Brahman - Each individual person has within the self Brahman, which, in a person, is called Atman - The secret of life is to come to the knowledge that Brahman is the ultimate reality (one’s inner self is part of this fundamental reality) and everything else is, in a certain fashion, permeable and “unreal . Hinduism . - “Those from the Indus Valley” - Highly ritualized worship of the gods - Strong traditions to find the ultimate reality of the cosmos and those who live in it - Hinduism is both a religion of the priest and the temple and of solitary meditation and study - Inside a person, Brahman is known as Atman: - Innermost, transcendental self - Material self causes inner self to be lost - True happiness and moksha (getting out of the samsara cycle) - Paths of Hinduism - The path of discipline (yoga) and aestheticism (fasting, bodily control) that leads away from materialism and towards enlightenment - The path of discipline of karma, performing your duties (sacrifice for greater good, selflessness) - The path of devotion in which all deeds are for the gods or one god, creating a spiritual life Hindu Art - Religious in Spirit - Decorate the temples in narrative stories of the Hindu deities - Eroticism: belief that sexual union is equal to union with the gods -The sense of unity of all forms of life is shown by Vishnu—the supreme Hindu spirit—appearing in a series of avatars, or incarnations, of various animals and humans - Over time, scenes from the Mahabharata and other great Hindu epics combined the elements of eroticism and naturalism . Buddhism . - Siddhartha Gautama (563-483 B.C.E.) - Lived a luxurious life until he observed the suffering in the real world - After years of studying, he found his enlightenment sitting under a tree in a vigil - Eightfold Path - Allows for the ascension to Nirvana Buddhist Art - Focus on spirituality - Calm, transcendent images - Highlights the spiritual nature of Buddhist doctrines Emperor Asoka - Spread the word of Buddha - Appalled by the suffering he caused he became a buddhist - Implemented many elements regarded with the growth of Buddhism - Helped the spread of Buddhism across East Asia Gupta Empire - Cultural Achievements, Economic Stability, and Religious Tolerance - Foundation of Large Universities - Scientific Discoveries - Mechanics, Mathematics, and Medicine .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .

Lists | A sequence of elements | . Dictionary | Used to store information in Python | . Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms . Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles : Various ways of representing data. . Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point : Floating points are decimals, unsigned integers are integers without a sing (abs value), and signed integers have signs . Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB - these are various representations of binary, ASCII is characters, unicode and RGB are colors, booleans are 1s and 0, on and off . Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed yet) : lossy is compressing, but you may lose data. Lossless is the opposite, as it does not lose data. . Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms - . Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators : Variables are variable holders of values, data types are the types of what they can be, and assignment operators assign values to variables . Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration : These are ways to manage complexity through abstraction of various data and procedures that influence . Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables : Ways of representing true and false operators, mainly between the 1s and 0s of binary. True trumps false in OR, but fails to in AND. . Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings : Strings are plaintext, and these are various ways of manipulating strings. Making them upper and lower case, adding more string to the string, and iterating over them. . Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements : Conditionals, if checks if something is true. Elif checks if the above if statement isn’t true, and else checks if nothing above ois true. . Python For, While loops with Range, with List : various loops to iterate over iterables. While loops have a conditional, loop over range loops over a range of numbers, and for loops over an iterable. . Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue : continue resets the loop, break breaks out of it Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values : Ways of managing complexity in repeatable procedures (def in python). These return return values and contain parameters that influence the output. .",
