    "1. DNS stands for Domain Name System.\n",
    "2. The purpose of DNS is to translate domain names (such as www.googl.com) into IP addresses that computers can use.\n",
    "3. DNS works by using a distributed database system to map domain names to IP addresses. When a user types a domain name into their browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS resolver, which then looks up the IP address associated with that domain name in a series of DNS servers until it finds the correct one. Once the IP address is found, the resolver returns it to the user's browser, which can then use it to establish a connection to the appropriate server.\n",
    "4. A DNS resolver is a computer program or service that retrieves information from DNS servers in order to resolve domain names into IP addresses. Resolvers are typically provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or by public DNS services such as Google Public DNS or OpenDNS. They are responsible for handling the DNS lookup process on behalf of client devices, such as computers or smartphones, that are trying to access websites or other resources on the Internet."

    "1. CORS stands for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, which is a mechanism that allows web servers to give permission to web browsers to access resources from a different domain than the one that served the original request. IT allows/blocks access from other domains.\n",
    "2. CORS can be implemented on a website by setting specific HTTP headers on the server-side response to requests from other domains. The headers that need to be set are \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", and \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\".\n",
    "3. Implementing CORS is important because it allows websites to access resources from different domains, which can improve the user experience and enable the development of more complex web applications that rely on resources from multiple domains.\n",
    "4. Using CORS can benefit developers in the future by enabling them to build more complex web applications that rely on resources from multiple domains, without having to worry about cross-origin security issues. It also allows developers to access data from APIs hosted on different domains, which can be useful in developing applications that rely on data from multiple sources.\n",
