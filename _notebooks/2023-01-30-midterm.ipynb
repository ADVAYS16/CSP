    "Analysis: This option is incorrect. If input B is true, then the resulting value coming out of the OR gate will be true. Since the value of C is true, the resulting value coming out of the AND gate is true. This result contradicts the statement. I think I was too quick to answer and was not careful with what I was clicking.\n",

If both val1 and val2 are true, result is set to false. If val2 is false, result is set to true. If val1 is false, result is set to false.\n",

As a result, the value of \"i\" will remain constant at zero and the loop will repeat forever.\n",

    "Overall I think I struggled with understanding College Board's Pseudocode and the Robot Movement questions. I can work on this by going back to the student lessons and learning more about the pseudocode terminology. I also think that I should take more time reading the question as I feel like I rushed into answering. This caused simple mistakes and lead to a lower overall score.\n"
