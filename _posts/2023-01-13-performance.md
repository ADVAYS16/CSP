    <td>Initially, I believed the student deserved the point because they explained the function and purpose, as well as described the input and output. After reviewing the college board scores I discovered that the student failed to meet the explanation requirements as they appeared to have mixed up their explanations of the function and purpose and the input and output was inaccurate. </td>

    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The student explains the purpose of the program, which is to "explore creativity" and describes how the program functions. They also mention how the output will vary based on user input. Meets all criteria.</td>

    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Response clearly explains how complexity is managed and explains how the program would be different. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Program Purpose and Function</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data Abstraction</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>The student has identified a list (guesses) and described its contents, but has not provided any information on the overall function or purpose of the list. According to the Collegeboard, this response does not meet their criteria as it only mentions that the data stored in the list is not being used and only the length of the list is accessed, without any explanation of its purpose. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Managing Complexity</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>0</td>
    <td>The response is inadequate as it fails to explain how the code could be written differently. Collegeboard suggests that the list is only being used as a counter and it could be replaced with a single counter variable. This would mean that the student does not fully understand the concept of the code and how it could be optimized.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Procedural Abstraction</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>The response is well-informed as it explains how the function works and how it contributes to the overall functionality of the program. The student has also developed a procedure (isitcorrect) that has a parameter. This shows that the student has a good understanding of the code and how it works within the program.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Algorithm Implementation</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>I agree with the Collegeboard's assessment that the response is good because it includes explanations of iteration, sequencing, and selection.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 6 Testing</td>
    <td>The response described the conditions being tested, rather than two different arguments that trigger different code execution. CB also mentioned that arguments should be specific values used in the procedure call.</td>

## Important things my program should contain!
- Make sure to meet every criteria as even if you meet 5 out of 6 requirements you receive a 0. TO insure this I should review my code and be as specific as possible in my written response. Do not write too much or be too sparse as a majority of the points come from the ability to explain the purpose and functionality of one's code.
