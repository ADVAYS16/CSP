    "1. DNS stands for Domain Name System.\n",
    "2. The purpose of DNS is to translate domain names (such as www.googl.com) into IP addresses that computers can use.\n",
    "3. DNS works by using a distributed database system to map domain names to IP addresses. When a user types a domain name into their browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS resolver, which then looks up the IP address associated with that domain name in a series of DNS servers until it finds the correct one. Once the IP address is found, the resolver returns it to the user's browser, which can then use it to establish a connection to the appropriate server.\n",
    "4. A DNS resolver is a computer program or service that retrieves information from DNS servers in order to resolve domain names into IP addresses. Resolvers are typically provided by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) or by public DNS services such as Google Public DNS or OpenDNS. They are responsible for handling the DNS lookup process on behalf of client devices, such as computers or smartphones, that are trying to access websites or other resources on the Internet."

The User-Agent header is a request header that is sent by the client to the server as part of an HTTP request. Its purpose is to identify the type of client software that is being used to make the request, such as a web browser, a search engine crawler, or a mobile app.\n",

    "   1. NGINX performs load balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers or instances, with the aim of enhancing web application availability, scalability, and performance. This is achieved by preventing any individual server from being overloaded with traffic. To determine how to distribute traffic, NGINX uses various load balancing algorithms, including round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.\n",

    "   \n",
    "2. CORS can be implemented on a website by setting specific HTTP headers on the server-side response to requests from other domains. The headers that need to be set are \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"Access-Control-Allow-Methods\", and \"Access-Control-Allow-Headers\".\n",

    "4. Using CORS can benefit developers in the future by enabling them to build more complex web applications that rely on resources from multiple domains, without having to worry about cross-origin security issues. It also allows developers to access data from APIs hosted on different domains, which can be useful in developing applications that rely on data from multiple sources.\n",
