<li><p>Unit 3 Section 9 - 11: 0.89/1</p>
<ul>
<li>I received the score stated above due to the fact that my notes were minimal and I had nothing extra. I felt that my notes were adequate as they helped me but I can understand why I might have lost points. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Unit 3 Section 12 - 13: 0.9/1</p>
<ul>
<li>I received said score due to the fact that I completed all requirements. I had nothing extra or specifically unique which resulted in me receiving a 0.9/1.</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Unit 3 Section 14 - 15: 0.9/1</p>
<ul>
<li>I received said score as I did not have anything extra.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Overall I feel like I received adequate scores as I did not have much extra. I think that I should try working extra over the weekend when I can rather than simply doing as much as I can during the week.</li>
