<h1 id="Our-Idea:-A-Dating-APP">Our Idea: A Dating APP<a class="anchor-link" href="#Our-Idea:-A-Dating-APP"> </a></h1><p>We aim to create a platform in which individuals are able to find romantic or platonic relationships. We aim to implement a chat box, google map integration, profile creation, profile matching, and personality testing. I will be working with all aspects of the project as one the main backend and frontend developers. I will however be spending more time focused on the map integration and the user interface. We have already created an overall theme to build off of and I would like to create a cohesive project integrating this theme. I will also be working on the google map integration. This feature will integrate and api and a database as we aim to show users in a specific area. This itself may not be enough for my Personal CPT but can be an smaller part of an overall project.</p>
<p>Our dating app meets several of the criteria set by the College Board for a Create performance task in AP Computer Science Principles. First, it includes user login and signup features, which allow individuals to create their own unique profiles and have secure access to the app. Additionally, the app includes a personality testing feature, which assesses individuals' personalities and interests and helps to match them with compatible partners. The app also integrates a map feature, which allows users to search for potential partners within a specific geographic area. The algorithmic matching feature uses a carefully designed algorithm to match individuals based on their personality and interests, which enhances the overall user experience. Furthermore, the app includes a chat feature that allows individuals to communicate with each other within the app, making it easier for them to get to know each other. Finally, the app stores user profiles in a database, ensuring that information is securely stored and can be easily accessed by users when needed. All these features collectively demonstrate the app's ability to meet the College Board's criteria for a Create performance task in AP Computer Science Principles.</p>
<p>CRUD Implementation:
One important aspect of the dating app project is the implementation of CRUD functionality. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete, which are the basic operations used to manage data in a database. In the context of the dating app, users will be able to create and update their profiles, search and read profiles of other users, and delete their profiles if they wish to leave the app. The implementation of CRUD functionality is critical to the success of the app, as it ensures that user data is properly managed and maintained.</p>
<p>College Board Criteria that are met:
The dating app project meets several of the criteria set by the College Board for a Create performance task in AP Computer Science Principles. The app includes features such as user login and signup, personality testing, map integration, algorithmic matching, chat functionality, and secure database storage. These features collectively demonstrate the app's ability to meet the College Board's criteria for a Create performance task, as they showcase the app's functionality, usability, and security.</p>
<p>Wireframe:
A wireframe is a visual representation of the app's user interface design. It outlines the layout and structure of each screen within the app, including the navigation flow and user interactions. Creating a wireframe is an essential step in the app development process, as it helps to ensure that the app's design is intuitive, user-friendly, and meets the project requirements. The wireframe for the dating app will serve as a blueprint for the app's development, helping to guide the implementation of each feature and functionality.</p>
<p>My Portion:
As one of the main backend and frontend developers, my portion of the project will involve working on the map integration and user interface design. I will be responsible for integrating the Google Maps API and database to display users within a specific area. Additionally, I will focus on creating a cohesive user interface design that aligns with the overall theme of the app. My contributions will be critical to the success of the project, as they will directly impact the usability and functionality of the app.</p>
<p>Overall Impact of Project:
The dating app project has the potential to make a significant impact on individuals looking for romantic or platonic relationships. By providing a user-friendly platform that incorporates advanced features such as personality testing and algorithmic matching, the app can help users to find compatible partners more easily. Additionally, the app's secure database storage and chat functionality will provide users with a safe and convenient way to communicate with each other. Overall, the app has the potential to revolutionize the way people find and connect with potential partners, making it a valuable contribution to the field of online dating.</p>
