<p>This week I worked on a Champion's league quiz on "Code.org". I wanted to test other's knowledge on the soccer tournament. I asked questions regarding the history of the league and recent winners. I used music, variables, images, and buttons in order to create this quiz. I had some difficulty trying to score the quiz and linking the buttons correctly. I set on events in order for the screens to change when a button or image is pressed. I utilized "score=score+1" in order to score the quiz and displayed the score on the final screen. I also added music from the point you start the quiz to the point the score is displayed. I think that I could have asked a few more questions in my quiz and utilized gifs or other forms of media in my quiz.</p>
