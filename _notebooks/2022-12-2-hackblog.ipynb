    "I unfortunately absent on Monday and Tuesday. Due to this I missed both of the lessons. I feel that I could have been more thorough with my work for both of the sections. Something I want to do next time is blog about the lessons or add my personal reflection. Along side these blog posts I feel that I should review the material taught by the group in order to gain a deeper understanding. I think that I should also write down what the homework for each section is as I found it hard to find where the hacks were posted. For my group project I spent time learning the material in order to better prepare for my lesson."
