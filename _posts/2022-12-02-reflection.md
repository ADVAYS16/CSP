# What I Received
- Sections 1-2: 0.8/1
  - I lost points due to the fact that I was missing a part of the 3.2 Video 2 Hacks. 
- Sections 3-4: 0.9/1
  - I lost points due to the fact that I did not go above and beyond. I completed all parts required but did not have anything extra such as a reflection or summary.

# My Thoughts

I unfortunately absent on Monday and Tuesday. Due to this I missed both of the lessons. I feel that I could have been more thorough with my work for both of the sections. Something I want to do next time is blog about the lessons or add my personal reflection. Along side these blog posts I feel that I should review the material taught by the group in order to gain a deeper understanding. I think that I should also write down what the homework for each section is as I found it hard to find where the hacks were posted. For my group project I spent time learning the material in order to better prepare for my lesson.
