    "I felt pretty good about my Final Attempt. I did struggle on a few questions and missed 6 in total. A Majority of the questions I missed were regarding the analysis of a specific piece of code. I was unsure on what the code did exactly and took an educated guess on a few of them. I feel that I could have done better if I had revised my answers as I feel that I could have caught some simple mistakes. Also I found it difficult to understand exactly what some of the coded segments were implying due to the format. \n",

    "Specifics: \n",
    "\n",
    "I was still confused on a few questions even after reviewing the answers. For example, question 35 was related to setting the value of a variable based of an existing value of time. I reviewed the answer and realized that my selected answer was assigning the opposite value. Instead of setting 30 for when time is greater than 1 I was setting 50. Although I see why Answer A is correct, I am still confused as why \"maxPS=50\" is placed above the if else statement.\n",

    "For the next final or test I feel that I can work on rereading and revisiting questions. By simply returning to a question with a blank mind, I feel like I could have approached the question differently. Many times I felt a bit confused by the format of the code and variables included. This confusion caused many of my mistakes and I feel that I could have answered them correctly by simply revisiting the question."
