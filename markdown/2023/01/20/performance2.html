## Important things my program should contain!
- It is important to review vocabulary related to programming, specifically iteration, selection, and sequence. Additionally, it is important to explain how the program would be different without the use of lists. When testing the program, ensure that there are two different calls to the procedure, instead of just describing the results that appear on the screen.
