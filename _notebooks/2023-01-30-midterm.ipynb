    "Analysis: This option is incorrect. If input B is true, then the resulting value coming out of the OR gate will be true. Since the value of C is true, the resulting value coming out of the AND gate is true. This result contradicts the statement. I think I was too quick to answer and was not careful with what I was clicking.\n",

As a result, the value of \"i\" will remain constant at zero and the loop will repeat forever.\n",

    "Overall I think I struggled with understanding College Board's Pseudocode and the Robot Movement questions. I can work on this by going back to the student lessons and learning more about the pseudocode terminology. I also think that I should take more time reading the question as I feel like I rushed into answering. This caused simple mistakes and lead to a lower overall score.\n"
