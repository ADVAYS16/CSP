I thought that this was a very cohesive project with an interesting idea. I was particularly interested by their way of matching users with dogs and I think they had a well crafted user experience. First I filled out a form regarding my day to day habits, and next I inputted my likings in dogs, and finally I was presented with different dog breeds and specific dogs which I could purchase. Another project I found interesting was a Hotel/Vacation Organizer. I thought that it was interesting as it allowed users to find houses to rent in specific parts of the world based on their liking and price point. I loved playing with an Arcade/Game Pigeon game project as well. It had 3 different types of games such as chess, checkers, and battleship. I loved how you could play chess live with another person.

WE had a great time working on our project but I think that we were somewhat unprepared during N@TM as it took us a great amount of time to learn how to use Svelte and Firebase. I think that we could have definitely worked with AWS and Fastpages but we decided to challenge ourselves. I think that we can grow our platform to a great extent through Svelte and Firebase but I think that the learning curve causes issues as it stops us from working on multiple aspects. It takes time to understand how to use it and then time to utilize it. Despite the challenges we faced, I think we did a great job as we had an interesting project with interesting features. | . | Other Classes: I had a great time visiting other classes. i was especially fascinated by the detail and quality of the projects showcased in Ceramics and AP Studio Art.

The licenses discussed included Apache License, various GNU Licenses, Mozilla Public License, MIT License, Boost Software License, The Unlicense, and Creative Commons. Each of these licenses has its own unique features and restrictions regarding the distribution and modification of source code. . Furthermore, the discussion centered around the legal and ethical implications of using and sharing data on the internet. We acknowledged the issues of data theft and copyright abuse and the impact it has on the digital space. We also talked about the growing concern of data brokers who collect information through legal means and sell it for profit, and how their practices, although legal, may be considered unethical by some. . For our College Board project, we decided to apply the MIT License to both the frontend and the backend of our CPT project. The team reached this decision because we believe that the MIT License provides a good balance between making the source code available and allowing for modifications. We also took into consideration that the frontend of the project, built on GitHub pages, may come with its own license and restrictions. We believe that this license aligns with our philosophy of making the source code available to anyone who wishes to modify it, while also allowing us to protect our work. . 5.6 . Describing Personal Identifiable Information (PII) seen on a project in Computer Science Principles: . During the project, PII was collected during the process of signing into various accounts, asking for information, and providing necessary information when running commands in the shell such as sudo. Examples of PII include biometric information inputted at various accounts. Personal Exposure to PII: . I do not have any posts or videos on the internet but I feel that my data has been exposed through data trackers, cookies, and digital footprint. In some way or form, my entire profile and interests are most likely available on the internet. I see very specific ads or videos showing up on my for you page based on my interests or personal life. . Good passwords are those that are long and contain a variety of symbols, not just ASCII symbols. On the other hand, bad passwords can be too simple, use easily guessable words, and lack variation. To enhance security, Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is often used as a secondary form of authentication, providing a more secure authentication process. Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption: . Symmetric encryption involves the use of the same algorithm to hash and rehash information when passwords are being passed. However, in asymmetric encryption, different keys and algorithms are used for hashing, requiring the secure keeping of different keys. Encryption Used in AWS Deployment: . In AWS deployment, server-side AES 256 encryption is used to secure information, with information being hashed back and forth when routing requests. This ensures the security of the information. Phishing Schemes: . Although I haven&#39;t personally fallen for any phishing schemes, I have encountered a scam in which fake youtube or instagram accounts create a giveaway in which you can enter. They then take your information and either sell it or use it as black mail. .",

            "content": "5.1 . Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing . Beneficial: Improved access to Free information: With the help of computers and the internet, we can access a vast amount of information and knowledge in just a few clicks. It used to be far more difficult to find information as one would have to find a book related to the subject and parse through it to find an answer. We know can simply search up any question and find quality answers. | Increased Tracing / Storage: Computers and technology has improved drastically over the past few decades and these improvements have created fundamental changes in many basic tasks. Our technology allows for better organization and therefore allows greater productivity. | Enhanced communication: We can communicate with people all over the world through email, video conferencing, and instant messaging. | . | Harmful: Addiction: Excessive use of technology can result in addiction, which can negatively impact our mental and physical health. | Decreased face-to-face interaction: Spending too much time online can lead to a decrease in real-life interactions, which can have a negative impact on our social and emotional well-being. This can also have negative impact on our physical health as we may be more inclined to staying in one place rather than meeting others outside. | Cyberbullying: The internet makes it easy to hide one&#39;s identity or purpose as it can be very discrete. This allows indvidiuals and primarily students to engage in cyberbullying as they are able to limit their risk of being caught. This can have detrimental effects on those who are being bullied. | . | . | Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School? . I definitely think that the access of dopamine may be an issue as it creates overstimulation. I have noticed that as I have started spending more time using devices and technology, I seem to get bored much quicker. As a kid it was very hard to get bored as I was always doing something but as I started spending more time with technology I felt that I would get bored quicker as there was less stimulation or easy dopamine in the real world then there was on the internet. I think I experienced this most during quarantine as I spent a majority of time inside on devices and I lacked self control. As I have grown and matured I have found ways of limiting my usage as it interferes with personal tasks. | . | . 5.2 . How does someone empower themself in a digital world? Individuals can empower themselves in the digital world by seeking opportunities to learn more about the use of technology. By learning new ways of utilizing technology, one can increase productivity and creativity. | . | How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS. We can help others at Del Norte by assisting students who may have limited understanding. At DNHS, I can provide tutoring or help to students taking classes I have already completed. | . | Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere? It is true that paper or red tape can block or hinder the progress of digital empowerment. This is because those in positions of power, such as the government, have the ability to control or restrict access to information. These barriers exist not only at Del Norte High School but also in other places. This power imbalance causes barriers such as censorship, lack of information, and misinformation. Despite efforts to ensure that everyone is informed, there will always be restrictions on information. We can work on this by trusting our fellow peers and being open minded. | . | .",

Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Shows how data is being stored but does not show how the data is being used to fulfill the program&#39;s purpose, list RPS is named, explains what the data represents (the different inputs) | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | Doesn&#39;t show how RPS is used to manage complexity, response explains how the code would be written differently without using RPS. CB also says that the list, &quot;results in a program that is just as easy to develop or maintain as the one with lists.&quot; | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | Student made procedure (rpsGame), parameter (yourPlay), does not explain how the procedure contributes to overall function | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 1 | Response includes sequencing and iteration (if else) but doesn&#39;t have selection, explains how someone else could recreate the algorithm. My grading differed from CB because I thought iteration was if-else but CB says, &quot;includes sequencing, selection (if statement), and iteration through use of recursion to call rpsGame again to execute.&quot; | .

Reporting Category Student Score College Board Score Comments . Program Purpose and Function | 0 | 1 | The purpose of the program is to learn more about the states. The program functions by allowing the user to input a state and displaying general information about the state. However, the student does not explain what the output is. The College Board gave the point because &quot;Both of these items are displayed on the general information screen.&quot; | . Data Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The student identified the list &quot;stateList&quot;, but does not explain what the list holds or how it is used to fulfill the program&#39;s purpose. The list only represents state names and the first code segment does not show how the list is used. | . Managing Complexity | 0 | 0 | The student does not explain how complexity is managed and does not name the list or explain how it specifically helps the program. The response is too general. | . Procedural Abstraction | 0 | 0 | The student does not identify the procedure or parameter, does not call the function, and does not explain how it contributes to the program&#39;s overall function. | . Algorithm Implementation | 0 | 0 | The student only talks about the use of if statements and is missing iteration. The response does not include how the program would be different without the algorithm or how to recreate the program. The College Board also says that the response is missing part of the explanation for updateScreen, &quot;The response does not state that the index value is set based on the match and what value is set for each U.S. state.&quot; | . Testing | 1 | 0 | The student made different calls, one input of 1 and h, and explains the conditions being tested. The results of the different inputs are different. However, the College Board said that the student&#39;s response described two calls from the specified procedure, rather than two calls to the specified procedure. In addition, this function does not have an implicit parameter for state. The student also does not specify the result of two calls to the given procedure, instead, it describes the result that appears on the screen. | . &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; Video 4 Grading . reporting category student score college board score comments . Program Purpose and Function | 1 | 1 | The purpose of the program is to stimulate the mind. The function of the program is a fishing game with scorekeeping. The student identifies the output and input of the program. | . Data Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student explains how data is stored and how the list is used for the program&#39;s purpose. The student identifies the name of the list as fishtypes and explains what is in the list (type of fish and specific number of fish caught). | . Managing Complexity | 1 | 1 | The student explains how the list manages complexity by compiling fish data into one spot. They also explain how the code would be different without the list, that it would add data of fish instead of making a new variable and that the code would be longer and less efficient. | . Procedural Abstraction | 1 | 1 | The student created the procedure &quot;clone movement&quot; with y1 and y2 parameters (the college board says there are five parameters). The procedure is called and the student explains how the procedure contributes to overall functionality of program. | . Algorithm Implementation | 1 | 1 | The student uses selection, sequencing, and iteration with if-else statements and loops. They provide a detailed explanation so that someone else could recreate the algorithm. | . Row 6 Testing | 0 | 0 | The student does not have two different calls to the procedure. The response does not correspond to how the parameters are used in the program. The student describes the code segments rather than the result of the call. | . ## Important things my program should contain! - It is important to review vocabulary related to programming, specifically iteration, selection, and sequence. Additionally, it is important to explain how the program would be different without the use of lists. When testing the program, ensure that there are two different calls to the procedure, instead of just describing the results that appear on the screen. | .",

            "content": "Hack 1 . Please write a short 1-2 sentence explanation describing the difference between decidable and undecidable problems. Make sure to provide at least one example of each. . Decidable problems: A problem in which an algorithm can be used to solve or produce outputs in a finite number of steps. Undecidable problems: A problems where there is no algorithm that can be built to provide a solution for all parameters. . number = 20 #set number equal to random value if number &gt; 10: # if the number is greater than 10 print(&quot;greater than 10&quot;) #print else: # if less than 10 print(&quot;not greater than 10&quot;) # print . greater than 10 . num = 1 while num == 0: # the number will never equal 0 since we set it to 1, so this is undecidable print(num) num = num + 1 . Hack 2 . Which of the following is a 3 step algorithm? . A. 2 x 6 x 8 . B. 4^5 . C. (3 x 8)^2 . A variable multiplied by an integer to the power of two. This algorithm fits this criteria. | . D. None of the above . E. All of the above . Hack 3 . Rewrite this JavaScript Code in a More Efficient Way (Hint: Use Binary Search) . function run_peak_finder() { let array_r= (3,5,7,5) print (peak_finder(array_r)) } function peak_finder(array){ let counter = 0 let peak = 0 let peak_index =0 while (counter &lt;= array.length){ console.log(counter) if (counter === 0){ if (a[0]&gt;=a[1]){ peak = a[0] peak_index = counter counter = array.length print (`The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak`) }else{ counter+=1 } }else if(counter === array.length-1){ if (a[array.length-1] &gt;= a[array.length-2]){ peak = a[array.length-1] peak_index = counter counter = array.length print(`The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak`) } }else{ if (a[counter]&gt; a[counter+1] &amp;&amp; a[counter]&gt; a[counter-1]){ peak = a[counter] peak_index = counter counter = array.length print (`The ${counter-1} indexed number, ${peak} is a peak`) }else{ counter += 1 } } } } . function findpeak(ar) { var peak = -Infinity; // Cycle through all the elements of the array for(var i = 0; i &lt; ar.length; i++) { var el = ar[i]; // If an element is of type array then invoke the same function // to find out the maximum element of that subarray if ( Array.isArray(el) ) { el = findpeak( el ); } if ( el &gt; peak ) { peak = el; } } return peak; } . I was a bit confused on how to tackle this problem and I tried to utilize a recursive function. I am not really sure how to write this code optimally and would like to learn more about recursive functions. . Hack 4 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def merge_sort(data): if len(data) &lt;= 1: return mid = len(data) // 2 left_data = data[:mid] right_data = data[mid:] merge_sort(left_data) merge_sort(right_data) left_index = 0 right_index = 0 data_index = 0 while left_index &lt; len(left_data) and right_index &lt; len(right_data): if left_data[left_index] &lt; right_data[right_index]: data[data_index] = left_data[left_index] left_index += 1 else: data[data_index] = right_data[right_index] right_index += 1 data_index += 1 if left_index &lt; len(left_data): del data[data_index:] data += left_data[left_index:] elif right_index &lt; len(right_data): del data[data_index:] data += right_data[right_index:] if __name__ == &#39;__main__&#39;: data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] merge_sort(data) print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . data = [9, 1, 7, 6, 2, 8, 5, 3, 4, 0] data.sort() print(data) . [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] . This method is much more efficient as it no longer needs while loops to sort through the data set. I utilized a built in method to sort the data. . Hack 5 . Rewrite this Python Code in a More Efficient Way . def heap_permutation(data, n): if n == 1: print(data) return from itertools import permutations perm = permutations([3,2,1]) for i in list(perm): print(i) . (3, 2, 1) (3, 1, 2) (2, 3, 1) (2, 1, 3) (1, 3, 2) (1, 2, 3) . Reflection . I am thoroughly interested in the recursive function and the utilization of the permutation method. I enjoyed learning about undecidable vs undecidable problems, and how to make code more efficient. I am not entirely sure on the uses of a recursive function and would like to learn more about how to apply it. | .",

He&#39;s currently working on a procedure to calculate average speed, based on this formula: . Average speed = Total Time/Total Distance​ . Highlight which of these is the best procedure for calculating and displaying average speed. . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance) { DISPLAY (distance/time) } . PROCEDURE calcAvgSpeed (distance, time) { DISPLAY (time/distance) } . | . Problem 2: Procedures with return values . James Hunter is looking through his classmate&#39;s program and sees a procedure called heightenEmotions: PROCEDURE heightenEmotions(myEmotion) . { moreEnergy ← CONCAT(myEmotion, &quot;!!!&quot;) . moreVolume ← UPPER(moreEnergy) . RETURN moreVolume } . That procedure manipulates strings using two built-in procedures, CONCAT for concatenating two strings together, and UPPER for converting a string to uppercase. . James Hunter then sees this line of code: . heightenEmotions(&quot;im mad&quot;) . After that line of code runs, will nothing be displayed? . True . False . I think &#39;IM MAD!!!&#39; will display as the upper() function converts lowercase letters to uppercase. The concat() function adds three exclamation marks. Therefore something will be displayed. | . Problem 3: Procedures with return values . Bubz is writing a program to calculate the carbon footprint of his activities. The procedure calcFlightFootprint calculates the pounds of carbon dioxide produced per passenger in a flight that covers a given number of miles and seats a given number of passengers. .

I feel that I agree with my scores and although I am proud of my work, I feel that I could have done something extra as I had time. . Vocab . Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms . Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles : Various ways of representing data. . Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point : Floating points are decimals, unsigned integers are integers without a sing (abs value), and signed integers have signs . Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB - these are various representations of binary, ASCII is characters, unicode and RGB are colors, booleans are 1s and 0, on and off . Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed yet) : lossy is compressing, but you may lose data. Lossless is the opposite, as it does not lose data. . Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms - . Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators : Variables are variable holders of values, data types are the types of what they can be, and assignment operators assign values to variables . Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration : These are ways to manage complexity through abstraction of various data and procedures that influence . Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables : Ways of representing true and false operators, mainly between the 1s and 0s of binary. True trumps false in OR, but fails to in AND. . Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings : Strings are plaintext, and these are various ways of manipulating strings. Making them upper and lower case, adding more string to the string, and iterating over them. . Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements : Conditionals, if checks if something is true. Elif checks if the above if statement isn’t true, and else checks if nothing above ois true. . Python For, While loops with Range, with List : various loops to iterate over iterables. While loops have a conditional, loop over range loops over a range of numbers, and for loops over an iterable. . Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue : continue resets the loop, break breaks out of it Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values : Ways of managing complexity in repeatable procedures (def in python).

Boolean- binary variable with only two possible values, &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; There are multiple operators used to evaluate 2 variables. In pseudocode the relational operators are =, &gt;, &lt;, ≠, ≥, and ≤. Python uses != instead of ≠. These operators help determine the boolean value of a statement. . Logical Operators . Logical operators allow for boolean values to be evaluated. Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. Javascript uses the same logic, but uses different ways to represent the operators:&amp;&amp;(and), | |(or), |(not). . &lt;/p&gt; Relational Operators Table Value 1 and Value 2(And operator) Value 1 Value 2 Result . True | True | True | . True | False | False | . False | True | False | . False | False | False | . Value 1 or Value 2(Or operator) Value 1 Value 2 Result . True | True | True | .

Write nested conditional statements, determine the result of them . Vocab and Big Ideas . Nested conditional:A conditional inside of a conditional. Used in algorithms in order to print specific data or run certain tasks, to create further conditions in algorithms.We can use flowcharts to help display an easy to understand diagram of what we want a code segment to do. | . . 3.5 Hacks .

Nice job! | Display | Please schedule a retake. | 75 | 3 &quot;Please schedule a retake.&quot; Because the if condition is met, 75 &lt; 80 so the if display is shown. | . 2. How is an if statement different from an if-else statement. . Extra words. | An if statement will only go through a process if a condition is met. An if-else statement will go through code no matter the conditions. | They are the exact same. | An if statement will go through the entire code segment every single time and the if-else statement is always used in an algorithm, no matter the conditions. | 2 Because in if statements the criteria needs to be made in order to go through the code. | . 3. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Ben wants to check his bank account. If his car fuel is full, he will go to the bank. Otherwise, he will go home. If he goes to the bank, he will withdraw money only if his balance is above $1000. . If statement | If-else statement | 2 If-else, because if he has gas he will go to the bank BUT else (gas is not full) he will go home. | . 4. What would be most appropriate for this situation? Luke wants to play basketball. If it is sunny outside he will go to the park to play basketball. . If statement | If-else statement | 1 as there is no second option. It does not specify what Luke will do on a day when it is not sunny. | . Using Python . animals = [&quot;lion&quot;, &quot;tiger&quot;, &quot;wildebeest&quot;, &quot;shark&quot;, &quot;jellyfish&quot;, &quot;blobfish&quot;, &quot;raven&quot;] for i in animals: if i == &quot;shark&quot;: # What boolean value does this statement cause?

            "title": "Final Corrections",
            "content": "Overall: . I felt pretty good about my Final Attempt. I did struggle on a few questions and missed 6 in total. A Majority of the questions I missed were regarding the analysis of a specific piece of code. I was unsure on what the code did exactly and took an educated guess on a few of them. I feel that I could have done better if I had revised my answers as I feel that I could have caught some simple mistakes. Also I found it difficult to understand exactly what some of the coded segments were implying due to the format. . Specifics: . I was still confused on a few questions even after reviewing the answers. For example, question 35 was related to setting the value of a variable based of an existing value of time. I reviewed the answer and realized that my selected answer was assigning the opposite value. Instead of setting 30 for when time is greater than 1 I was setting 50. Although I see why Answer A is correct, I am still confused as why “maxPS=50” is placed above the if else statement. . Question 36: . Consider the following code segment, which is intended to store ten consecutive even integers, beginning with 2, in the list evenList. Assume that evenList is initially empty. . i ← ← 1 REPEAT 10 TIMES { &lt;MISSING CODE&gt; } Which of the following can be used to replace &lt;MISSING CODE&gt; so that the code segment works as intended? . My code did not generate the correct list. Instead of initializing 1 it initialized 0. . Question 40: I said that nothing will be displayed. This is incorrect as the code segment will display regardless of x and y values. . Question 41: I selected the initial value of P rather than the value of r after the code has ran. . Question 45: . Consider the following code segment. theList ← ← [-2, -1, 0, 1, 2] count1 ← ← 0 count2 ← ← 0 FOR EACH value IN theList { IF(value &gt; 0) { count1 ← ← count1 + 1 } ELSE { count2 ← ← count2 + 1 } } What are the values of count1 and count2 as a result of executing the code segment? I am unsure of my mistake and need help understanding why this occurred. . Question 48: My answer was incorrect as Y is changing after the code segment runs. . What Next?: . For the next final or test I feel that I can work on rereading and revisiting questions. By simply returning to a question with a blank mind, I feel like I could have approached the question differently. Many times I felt a bit confused by the format of the code and variables included. This confusion caused many of my mistakes and I feel that I could have answered them correctly by simply revisiting the question. . .",

            "content": "Night at the Museum was an incredible experience and I had a great time. I enjoyed visiting other classes and experiencing other teams present their projects. One team had created a forum in which users could comment and write, which I found captivating. I was also able to reflect on my groups work. For example, after reviewing other projects, I felt that we could have integrated our different roles in a singular element. I saw a group who had built a hangman in which they used an api, stored data, and had frontend design. Unlike our group, they were able to make a project in which all items could be used in one element. Another class I visited was 3D Animation. I was surprised by the realism and noticed the intricacy involved. Many of the animations had shadows and a subject which captured my attention. I was really interested in Ceramics. I plan on taking the class later in highschool and was fascinated by the designs. I felt that the octopus was by far the best one. It had specific tentacles and suckers. Lastly, it felt good to present our work and effort. Images can be seen below. .

I utilized &quot;score=score+1&quot; in order to score the quiz and displayed the score on the final screen. I also added music from the point you start the quiz to the point the score is displayed.

            "content": "Note Participation: Ancient India . Indus Valley Civilization (3000-1700 BCE) . - Agriculture Based Society - First to utilize Cotton - Highly Religious Life - Weight Systems for Trading - Drainage System - Pottery - 1700 BCE - Culture changed massively soon after the mass floods and invasions from the northern Arayans . The Aryans . - (1500-500 BCE) - Tribal/Aggressive - Spoke Sanskrit - Created a Caste System - Priests, Warriors, Rulers, Merchants, Laborers, and Outcasts - Highly Technical - Keen sense of technology for bronze work - Ramayana and Mahabharata were written to reflect the centuries earlier warring periods - Epic Poems have sustained throughout history and are still present in society . The Ramayana . - Rama is an avatar of the god Vishnu. - Rama is born the son of Dasharatha, the King of Kosola - He has an auspicious birth. The first of four sons after a long period of kingly infertility. - One day, the sage, Vishvamitra comes looking for help dealing with the Rakshasas. - Married to Sita - 12 years later, Bharata, Rama&#39;s younger brother, is named his father’s successor instead of Rama - Rama is banished to the forest for 14 years with Sita and his loyal brother Lakshmana - Defeat a demon, visit a hermitage, receive a magical bow with infinite arrows, make friends with a celestial eagle who promises to watch over Sita - The Rakshashas learn of Rama&#39;s exile and send an army of 14,000 that Rama defeats with his magic bow - When Sita is left alone, Ravana swipes her in his flying chariot - The wounded protector eagle tells Rama where to find Ravana and Sita - Their journey leads them to the Monkey Kingdom and Rama impresses the monkey king with his archery so the monkeys agree to help him . The Mahabharata . - Important source of information on the development of Hinduism between 400 BCE and 200 CE - Regarded by Hindus as both a text about Dharma (Hindu moral law) and history - The poem was an oral epic that reflects the intersection of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism - The poem is made up of almost 100,000 couplets divided into 18 parvans - Traditionally ascribed to the sage Krishan Dwaipayana Vyasa - Exposition of dharma (codes of conduct), - Proper conduct of a king, of a warrior, of an individual living in times of calamity, and of a person seeking to attain moksha (freedom from samsara, or rebirth) - The Mahabharata is a mass of mythological material arranged around a heroic narrative of the struggle for power between two groups of cousins, the Kauravas (sons of Dhritarashtra, the descendant of Kuru) and the Pandavas (sons of Pandu) -The first section is a dramatic gambiling match with Yudhishthira, the weak and confused embodiment of dharma and the trickster Duryodhana who humiliates Draupadi and unleashes the uncontainable energy of the conflict -Hanuman is a monkey - The son of the wind and he is able to fly over the ocean to locate Sita - Rama leads a monkey army across the sea to battle Ravana&#39;s forces for several days ending when Rama shoots Ravana in the heart - Rama does not immediately take back Sita because he said it would be dishonorable to be with a woman who was with someone else for a year - Sita goes through a trial by fire to prove her faithfulness - When she steps into a fire, the fire god protects her, proving her purity - Rama accepts Sita and says he only questioned her to preserve his dharma, his individual duties and responsibilities within the cosmic pattern - Rama asks the god Indra to bring all the monkeys who died in the war back to life - Rama and Sita fly with all the monkeys to Ayodhya, where Rama is crowned king and rules wisely over his kingdom for 10,000 years - Shows the principles of dharma to behave appropriately as a dutiful son, a brother, a powerful military leader, a protector of his beloved, and a stern leader. . Aryan Religion . - Development of an elaborate religious system that placed enormous emphasis on ritual sacrifice to the pantheon of gods - Priests had the highest place in the caste system because of their responsibility in carrying out the religious ceremonies in honor of the gods - The rituals were highly complex and had to be carried out exactly according to tradition for their goal (fertility of the soil, rain, ect.) - Passed down through oral tellings - Around 1000 BCE the texts were committed to written down as the Vedas, the oldest bodies of religious writing known - The Vedas represent the oldest strain of Indian religious literature and are still chanted by Hindus at all important moments in Indian religious life (birth, naming ceremonies, rites of passage to adulthood, in sickness, and at death) Philosophy - Rig Veda, a new kind of literature came into being interested in the large philosophical issues of the nature of human existence Recorded in classical Indian texts - Upanishads - The fundamental worldview of the Upanishads is identified in two forms: - The ultimate reality is an impersonal reality called Brahman - Each individual person has within the self Brahman, which, in a person, is called Atman - The secret of life is to come to the knowledge that Brahman is the ultimate reality (one’s inner self is part of this fundamental reality) and everything else is, in a certain fashion, permeable and “unreal . Hinduism . - “Those from the Indus Valley” - Highly ritualized worship of the gods - Strong traditions to find the ultimate reality of the cosmos and those who live in it - Hinduism is both a religion of the priest and the temple and of solitary meditation and study - Inside a person, Brahman is known as Atman: - Innermost, transcendental self - Material self causes inner self to be lost - True happiness and moksha (getting out of the samsara cycle) - Paths of Hinduism - The path of discipline (yoga) and aestheticism (fasting, bodily control) that leads away from materialism and towards enlightenment - The path of discipline of karma, performing your duties (sacrifice for greater good, selflessness) - The path of devotion in which all deeds are for the gods or one god, creating a spiritual life Hindu Art - Religious in Spirit - Decorate the temples in narrative stories of the Hindu deities - Eroticism: belief that sexual union is equal to union with the gods -The sense of unity of all forms of life is shown by Vishnu—the supreme Hindu spirit—appearing in a series of avatars, or incarnations, of various animals and humans - Over time, scenes from the Mahabharata and other great Hindu epics combined the elements of eroticism and naturalism . Buddhism . - Siddhartha Gautama (563-483 B.C.E.) - Lived a luxurious life until he observed the suffering in the real world - After years of studying, he found his enlightenment sitting under a tree in a vigil - Eightfold Path - Allows for the ascension to Nirvana Buddhist Art - Focus on spirituality - Calm, transcendent images - Highlights the spiritual nature of Buddhist doctrines Emperor Asoka - Spread the word of Buddha - Appalled by the suffering he caused he became a buddhist - Implemented many elements regarded with the growth of Buddhism - Helped the spread of Buddhism across East Asia Gupta Empire - Cultural Achievements, Economic Stability, and Religious Tolerance - Foundation of Large Universities - Scientific Discoveries - Mechanics, Mathematics, and Medicine . Summary: . The Indus Valley Civilizations led to the arrival of the Aryan People. These people were highly technical and literary experts.

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .

Lists | A sequence of elements | . Dictionary | Used to store information in Python | . Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms . Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles : Various ways of representing data. . Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point : Floating points are decimals, unsigned integers are integers without a sing (abs value), and signed integers have signs . Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB - these are various representations of binary, ASCII is characters, unicode and RGB are colors, booleans are 1s and 0, on and off . Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless (not discussed yet) : lossy is compressing, but you may lose data. Lossless is the opposite, as it does not lose data. . Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms - . Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators : Variables are variable holders of values, data types are the types of what they can be, and assignment operators assign values to variables . Managing Complexity with Variables: Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration : These are ways to manage complexity through abstraction of various data and procedures that influence . Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables : Ways of representing true and false operators, mainly between the 1s and 0s of binary. True trumps false in OR, but fails to in AND. . Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings : Strings are plaintext, and these are various ways of manipulating strings. Making them upper and lower case, adding more string to the string, and iterating over them. . Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements : Conditionals, if checks if something is true. Elif checks if the above if statement isn’t true, and else checks if nothing above ois true. . Python For, While loops with Range, with List : various loops to iterate over iterables. While loops have a conditional, loop over range loops over a range of numbers, and for loops over an iterable. . Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue : continue resets the loop, break breaks out of it Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values : Ways of managing complexity in repeatable procedures (def in python). These return return values and contain parameters that influence the output. .",
